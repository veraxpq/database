This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
#install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)

# perform SQL queries on the built-in 'iris' data frame
sqldf("select * from iris limit 5")
sqldf("select count(*) from iris")
sqldf("select Species, count(*) from iris group by Species")

# note that each sqldf query actually returns a data frame
rs <- sqldf("select Species, count(*) as num from iris group by Species")
mean(rs$num)
```
```{r}
library(RSQLite)


dbfile = "MediaDB.db"
fpath = "/Users/pengqing/"

dbcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(fpath, dbfile))
```

```{r}
library(sqldf)
sqldf("select * from invoice_items")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
